Weddings are always more fun when have you a safe, affordable, nearby location to spend the night. Thankfully, we've got that covered for you!

The official hotel of the Allie & Derek wedding extravaganza is the **Courtyard by Marriott**, and we are pleased to be able to offer you a special rate if you book through this site: [Book here for the special rate!](http://cwp.marriott.com/cakcy/tobinschneiderwedding/)

You _don't_ have to stay there, but if you do, not only do you get the special rate, we are excited to be able to offer you a free shuttle from the hotel to Hale Farm and back!
