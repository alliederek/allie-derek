![Hale Farm](./hale-farm-barn.jpg)

We'll be having both our ceremony and reception at **Hale Farm & Village** in **Bath, Ohio**.

The ceremony :ring: will take place outside in the apple :apple: orchard, and we'll have the reception inside at the gatehouse. The two locations are within walking distance of each other.

### What?! That's not Cleveland!!

Oh you know us too well. We love Cleveland, and yes, its a bit surprising that we aren't hosting our shindig in the forest city, but Hale Farm is only a 30 minute drive south of Cleveland!

Although we wouldn't trade our city living for anything in the world, we love spending our weekends running :running: and biking :bike: in Cleveland's parks. Hale Farm is located within biking distance of one our favorites, the [Cuyahoga National Park](https://www.nps.gov/cuva/index.htm) and more specifically, [the Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath](https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm).
