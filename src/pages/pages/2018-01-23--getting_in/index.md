Flying into the area could not be easier! Hale Farm and Village is located between two well-serviced airports. If you are staying closer to the Cleveland area we recommend [Cleveland Hopkins International Airport](http://www.clevelandairport.com):

If you're staying a little more south, closer to Akron, then we recommend [Akron-Canton Airport](http://www.akroncantonairport.com/):

Although we are partial to Cleveland Hopkins, both airports offer affordable flights, and easy access to rental cars.
