## June 16th, 2018

It's a Saturday, so you'll be able to kick it with us the entire night. Festivities start at 6:00 PM in the apple orchard. A happy-hour :cocktail: will follow immediately afterwards in front of the gatehouse.

From there we'll have our reception with dinner :fork_and_knife:, desert :donut:, drinks :beer: :coffee:, and dancing :dancer: before wrapping up the evening around 11.
